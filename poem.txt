The Workforce Sucks

I work day and night,
I slave for you.
I get sick,
You kick me out.
There's nothing I can do,
The work force sucks.
It drains your life.
You're left with no energy,
No will to fight.
Until you wither away,
Left alone to die.
There is no one left now,
No one to cry.
As you close your eyes.
You begin to drift,
A silent whisper,
"Did you get someone to cover your shift?".

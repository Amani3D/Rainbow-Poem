The Workforce Sucks

I work day and night,
I slave for you.
I get sick,
Work sucks
You kick me out.
There's nothing I can do,
The work force sucks.
Work sucks
It drains your life.
You're left with no energy,
No will to fight.
Work sucks
Until you wither away,
Left alone to die.
There is no one left now,
Work sucks
No one to cry.
As you close your eyes.
You begin to drift,
Work Sucks
A silent whisper,
"Did you get someone to cover your shift?".
Work sucks
